# Data Science Portfolio

This readers guide provides a guide to the notebooks I've worked on during the minor. The guide will be in chronological order, starting with the first steps into data science at the beginning of the minor project.

## Preprocessing

To practice with python and pandas, we got a dataset from TNO to practice on. This was a public dataset found on Kaggle and consisted of Agora marketplace data. The [first notebook](./Dennis_van_Oosten_1_Preprocessing.ipynb) shows the preprocessing script I created after trying out a lot of different methods. This script will help easily choose what preprocessing methods we want to use in the future of the project.

## Bag of Words

To make a first attempt in vectorization I tried applying Bag of Words to our data. See [notebook 2](./Dennis_van_Oosten_2_Bag_of_Words.ipynb).
