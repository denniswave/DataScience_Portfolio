    "To test if our model was functioning properly, we wanted to test it against another dataset. To do this, we fed the new data to our best functioning model: Linear SVC with tf-idf vectorizing. Since the data seemed preprocessed already for all candidates in the Kaggle competition, we did not use our own preprocessing method (it does not seem to to much of a difference anyway on our own Kaggle dataset). The highest accuracy on Kaggle was 0.91. Our algorithm accomplished 0.90. It seems that we are on the right path according to this test. "
