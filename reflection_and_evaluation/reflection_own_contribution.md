#  Reflection on own contribution to the project

## Situation
The minor project started in september of 2019 and ends in januari 2020. It is the minor Applied data science of The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The minor consists of a written test and a group project. This reflection will be on this group project. My group is 5 man strong and the project is TNO's darkweb classifier. The goal of the project is to make a  multi-class text classifier to be able to distinguish topics Interpol is interested in from dark web forums or sellers descriptions. The group will be working on this project at school and on site at TNO during the 18-week minor project.

## Task
My task in this project was, just like the other group members, to: 
- Get to know python and learn it specifically in the field of data science.
- Work on several data visualization, preprocessing, vectorization and machine learning methods.
- Attend meetings at TNO.
- Prepare and present some of the presentations (open or closed).
- Contribute to writing the research paper.

## Actions
I participated in all the tasks. Learning python wasn't that difficult, because I had programming knowledge and did use python in an earlier project already. In the beginning of the project, we all worked on getting to know the python language and learning what steps is takes to create a pipeline for python. Data science and pandas was something I still had to learn. It took me about two weeks to get to know the language and gain enough knowledge to create a first preprocessing script. After this, I worked on several notebooks for different purposes. Overall, I worked on my notebooks that contributed to the project in one way or another, I did several presentations, attended the meetings and contributed to the research paper. 

## Result
After quite a short period, I managed to create a preprocessing script which was useful to the whole group. During the project I created some useful notebooks. For example; combining a few algorithms to determine which worked best and making confusion matrices which gave insight in the different methods. I started working on the research paper early on so we wouldn't have to do everything in the end. One of my strong points during the project was preprocessing. I built the first versions of a preprocessing script, which helped easily use different preprocessing methods. Also, I created some nice confusion matrices of different models early on and I created some structured, filtered and balanced data frames so we could easily switch between different sets of data.

## Reflection
I think this project went quite well. There isn't a lot I would do differently next time. I learned a lot regarding machine learning by trying a lot of different methods and applying them to our project data. Also, I never made a research paper before or used LaTeX. I found this quite interesting to learn. I think my contribution to the project was good. I feel like I made a good contribution and accomplished results that were helpful for the whole group. I spend the same amount of time and effort as the other members and feel like we all made a great effort.
