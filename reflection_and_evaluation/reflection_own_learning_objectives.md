#  Reflection on own learning objectives

## Situation
The minor project started in september of 2019 and ends in januari 2020. It is the minor Applied data science of The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The minor consists of a written test and a group project. The goal of the project is to make a multi-class text classifier to be able to distinguish topics Interpol is interested in from dark web forums or sellers descriptions. This reflection will be on my personal learning objectives during the project as well as the things I’ve learned during the lectures. 

My learning objective when I chose this minor was mainly to learn how machine learning works and how to apply it. Also, since the minor was in English, it would be a good opportunity to get a bit better at communicating in English.

## Task
My tasks were to attend the lectures to gain knowledge about the field of data science and machine learning, to work on the project and to attend and give presentations for other groups.

## Actions
I attended the lectures about machine learning and neural networks and therefore learned about these subjects. During the project I used a lot of different methods to apply the machine learning to our project data. A lot of different things were tried which allowed me to gain experience with many different aspects of machine learning. Where the lectures were mainly about general subjects and mostly numerical machine learning, the project was about Natural Language Processing (NLP). Because our project was quite different in this way, I got to learn about both aspects of machine learning. 

During the presentations and lectures I got to work on my English. All lectures were taught in English and during the presentations I presented in English myself. Because my entire project group was Dutch, I didn’t have to use English for the rest of the minor.

## Result
The lectures and the project resulted in a better understanding of machine learning. The project resulted in a paper and a pipeline for TNO to use. 

## Reflection
I learned a lot from actively trying things during the project. Because there were a lot of thing to try out, I repeated and tweaked the same methods and tried out a lot of different things. This resulted in a good understanding of the working and steps of machine learning and NLP. I found this very interesting to learn and I am glad I now know more about how this works. The learning process was what I expected from it. I think my expectations for a minor of half a school year were met: gain some knowledge about a certain subject and know how to apply it. I am glad I chose this minor and I am happy with the things I’ve learned.
