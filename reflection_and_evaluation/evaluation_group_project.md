#  Evaluation on the group project as a whole

## Situation
I followed the minor Applied data science at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in the first half of the 2019/2020 study year. The minor consists of a written test and a group project. The goal of the project is to make a multi-class text classifier to be able to distinguish topics Interpol is interested in from dark web forums or sellers descriptions. This document will reflect on the group project as a whole; how did the project go and what were the final results? 

## Task
TNO was the client in this project. They were working on an international project called TITANIUM. The TITANIUM project aims to better solve crimes on the dark web. One of the ways this can be achieved is to get better insight into what is sold where on the dark web to be able to better trace criminal activity and the rise of new sellers or products. The ultimate goal for TNO in this bigger, international collaboration is to create a dashboard that international law enforcement can use to track activity on the dark web. For example: what markets are biggest and what share of products is sold on what markets. To do this, one of the things that is needed is to categorize the topics that are discussed on forums and offered for sale on the markets by looking at descriptions and messages. This is exactly what the task for out project was. We had to create a pipeline that was capable of classifying text into these topics and write a paper about it.

## Actions
The group was new to data science and therefore started with getting familiar in this field. After this, the group worked together by all trying different methods for creating different parts of the pipeline in order to eventually determine which combination would give the best result. After this, code would be given to TNO and findings would be published in a paper.

## Result
The group booked some great results. A pipeline was created that was capable of classifying text data from a scraped Agora dataset with an accuracy of 95% and do the same for a scraped webIQ dataset with an accuracy of 87%. This will allow for TNO to use this pipeline for their dashboard or to at least use this as a starting point and try to improve scores from here. The paper gives an insight in the project and how the group came to this particular pipeline.

## Reflection
The group performed really well. Everyone did their part and tried their best at trying out different things. I had a great time working with everyone and I am glad at the end result the group achieved during this project.
