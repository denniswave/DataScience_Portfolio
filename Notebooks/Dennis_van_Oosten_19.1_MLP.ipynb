    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The model has a pretty good accuracy score. Just a few percent lower than linear svc without a neural network. The learning rate concerns me though. The loss keeps declining slower and slower. This probably means the model is  overfitting. I tried to solve this by decreasing the tolerence so the model would stop training sooner. This did not really helpt though. I should probably adjust the value or the number of the weights. The most commonly used is to adjust the value of the weights by altering the penalty (alpha in this case). This is exactly what I tried. The result was that the model showed a decrease on a different number than zero. Aka; it evened out around 0.2 instead of 0.00. This is a good sign. In theory, the model should be more generalized now. \n",

    "When I tried increasing the penalty though, the higher the training loss ended on, the weaker the model performed. I don't know why this is.\n",
